About me? That's a tough question because I'll either say more than you really wanted to hear, or I won't say enough to be interesting. I'm a husband, father, and software developer by trade. I spend too much time on the computer, and some time gardening. The rest of the time is spent with my family. I enjoy learning new things, especially if they have to do with technology, science, raising children, or gardening.
