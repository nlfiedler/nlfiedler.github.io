For 10 years I’ve been writing basically nothing but Java code, and for the most part Java tools. Looking at the hype around Ruby/Rails, Groovy, Python, and other dynamic scripting languages, I just turned up my nose and looked away. OOP snob? Er… uh… um… yes. Sorry, I can’t deny it. But just a few weeks spent on the “other side” changed everything for me.

   

A project at work forced me to learn [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/). Note that first I had to learn Ruby, then I could make some progress with Rails. I wonder how many thousands of developers have done the same thing—learn a language and a framework at basically the same time. Thankfully, if you know Java, learning Ruby is actually quite easy. Which begs another question: how many Java developers are now picking up Ruby, because of Rails?

   

So what else has changed, you might ask? Well, the Java debugger that I created and maintained for eight years has migrated entirely to [SourceForge](http://jswat.sourceforge.net/) for posterity. Meanwhile, this web site has been transformed by means of [Radiant CMS](http://radiantcms.org/) and [Typo](http://www.typosphere.org/). But that’s not much, you say? Well, how about authoring a few Rails applications to keep myself busy, now that I’m not writing Java code. Okay, I haven’t actually started writing them yet, but I’ve got at least four that I want to create and release as open-source.

   

Aside from writing code, just keeping up with the fast moving Ruby/Rails community is a full-time job in itself. There’s almost a million technologies and terms to learn, or at least it feels that way: DRY. REST, database migrations, RSpec, domain-specific languages, [mongrel](http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/), [capistrano](http://www.capify.org/), MySQL, agile development, and so on. It’ll be a miracle if I ever start writing code.

   

I suppose that’s it, in a nutshell. A long-time Java guy that has left the valley of Java tools and started to explore the world on the other side of the hill. I have to admit, it was a little scary, and I was initially hesitant, but it is so much more exciting when you get out and see new horizons.

   

Thanks Matz. Thanks David. Thanks Sun, for leading me away from Java. I needed the fresh air.
