We are in the midst of remodeling our kitchen. The plumbing was finished very quickly, in just two days. It took me a bit longer to get the walls patched though. I settled on using cement board and furring strips to get the new material to be flush with the existing (irregular) wall surface. The good news is the water pressure is much better than before, and the new fixtures in the bathroom make it feel like a mini-remodeling.

   

Yesterday my wife and I were determining the costs of the kitchen remodeling and we seem to be looking at about $16,000 for the total cost. That includes the plumbing, tiling, cabinets, and appliances. It’s hard to imagine that you can spend more than $2,000 on a refrigerator or an oven, but you can actually spend much more than that. Thankfully we are going for appliances that look good and have a good reputation. Nonetheless, we will be spending almost half of our budget on just the appliances.

   

This got me thinking that if a burglar really wanted to make out well, he’d take the kitchen appliances, not the DVD player or computer. Those things are practically a dime-a-dozen, when compared to the $2000 oven and $2500 refrigerator we’re considering. But I guess the fact that the oven weighs 250 pounds, and fridge is too large to fit in most getaway cars, prevents them from being targets. That’s a good thing, as I’d rather replace the DVD player than have to move a new fridge into my house.
