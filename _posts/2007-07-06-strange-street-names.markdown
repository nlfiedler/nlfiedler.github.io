Near my parents house is a street named “2nd Place”. The only name worse than that would be “Last Place”, which is not a very likely street name, of course, but you could be led wonder when you see a name like Second Place. In Pennsylvania there is/was a street called “Gunpowder Lane” (or Street, or whatever). My Mom knew someone that lived there. They said the name used to be something reasonable, but some committee decided to change it. Needless to say, some of the homeowners were not too happy about that.

   

Just past Newberg, on highway 99W, there is a road named “Veritas Lane”. Imagine, if you live on that road you must always tell the truth.

   

I’m sure there are many more names, just as strange as these, but that’s all I can remember.

   

By the way, I’m writing this from my iPhone, which is working remarkably well. I found that if the phone gets too hot, it freezes until its temperature lowers. It would be nice if it would warn you, though.

   

**Update:** the reason for my remarks regarding street names is that, as a developer, I have to think about names all the time. Every chunk of code that a developer writes has to be given some sort of name, and you don’t want to be the loser that names your functions “myfunction”, “function1”, or “doSomething”. So, I see these street signs and immediately pick apart the name, look at alternate meanings, and try to guess what the “developer” who named them was thinking.
