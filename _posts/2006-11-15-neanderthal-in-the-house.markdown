We have a little Neanderthal in our house. She’s 13 months old and just started walking in the last week. It’s quite amazing to watch her go from crawling all around the place to walking. It was the strangest thing, actually. Just one day she started walking, and she hasn’t stopped since. Granted, she had been taking one or two steps for the last couple of weeks, and we’d been helping her try out the walking thing. But to see her suddenly start doing it all by herself is nothing short of miraculous. One of my favorite quotes is by Albert Einstein:

   

<blockquote>

> There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a miracle.
