A few colleagues and I attended the first geekSessions this evening, which included a panel discussion regarding scaling Rails applications. It as very illuminating for us, as we’ve read very little on the subject, and have basically no experience whatsoever. In fact, we all just started learning Ruby and Rails three months ago.

   

One of the interesting comments from the questions afterward was that running a Rails app in JRuby on Glassfish was as much as five times faster than native Ruby in Mongrel. I thought it was JRuby that was slower, but perhaps it’s time to do some benchmarking of our own.
